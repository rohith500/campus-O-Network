## Not Completed in Sprint 1 and Reasons
Superadmin page
We first need to integrate it with the real backend so we can keep track of approved organizations

Search page for student clubs
We need to integrate with the backend first so we will prioritize this in the next sprint.

## Sprint 1 Summary

Sprint 1 focused on setting up the angular pages with basic landing and sign up / login pages. We will focus on building the post related pages in the next sprint with focus on integrating with the actual backend.
