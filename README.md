# Name : campus-O-Network

## Description : project is a campus community platform that combines club discovery with a public campus feed and Discord-like group chat, designed to reduce friction for students who feel lost, stressed, or hesitant to join communities. Students can browse what’s happening on campus before joining anything, then seamlessly move into structured club channels.

## Objectives
1. Make discovery effortless : Help students find clubs/events/study groups using tags, filters, and a campus-wide public feed.
2. Reduce joining friction : Provide smart onboarding and “recommended channels” so new members know where to start.
3. Enable real-time coordination ; Offer structured club channels and real-time chat for announcements, Q&A, and event planning.
4. Support study collaboration ; Let students create/join study groups matched by course/topic and availability, with time-boxed group spaces.
5. Keep the platform safe and trustworthy ; Add ambassador verification, reporting, moderation tools, and audit logs.

## Goals 

1. Students can go from feed → event/study group → chat in under 2 minutes.
2. Clubs can promote events and convert viewers into members/RSVPs.
3. Moderation/reporting is clear, fast, and traceable.
4. The system stays responsive with pagination, indexing, and rate limiting.
